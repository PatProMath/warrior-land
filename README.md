# Warrior Landscape

## Summary

I made an 'Warrior Land Journey' story of my own using if, elif and else statements. The warrior character gets to make choices from some general options. 
I based the story on the story of the Walls of Jericho in the Bible. 
Enjoy! 

### Flow chart
[To write your code according to my story, you can use this flow chart from draw.io to help you.](I had to skip out on a flow chart, because the logic is really much. I just kept thinking of a scenario. Maybe another time)

However, I think the fun part is writing your *own* story 😊

That said if you'd like to continue with my example, feel free to use the text snippets below...

### Meanwhile...
I want to code a story based on any of the Isekai Mangas, or manhwas I've read. I'm thinking TBATE🧙‍♂️  and Solo Leveling🙀

#### Alternative Story Idea: City of Troy

I want to also try making another story based on the City of Troy and the characters in the City. I want to use the user's personality to choose the characters in the Troy story:

* 'Are you generally a flirt or someone carried away by pretty things -- You are like Amnon, Paris'

* 'Are you by default, a damsel in distress --- Yes? Then, you are Helen'

* 'Are you a brave female? -- Here comes trouble from the  Women of Troy; you are Hecuba, then'

* 'Odysseus'

* 'Achaen' and so on... (from ***The Trojan Horse*** and the ***Women of Troy***)


##### Extensions

Have a think about how you might write your program to make a player's answers less case-sensitive. In other words, your code should work regardless of whether your user answers "left" or "Left".

[You can also add your own ASCII art](https://ascii.co.uk/art). Just remember to add three single quotes `'''` at the start and at the end of your artwork to turn it into a multi-line string.
